code to generate a sqlite database
from a spark job on all ripe atlas traceroute
data for a single day

The spark job code is in ./spark/
(for reference)

The spark job creates a file with lines like this:
  prb_id, IP           , count, min_rtt, pct95_rtt, pct99_rtt
[[14881,"4.69.203.173"],[82,14.633,128.64395,136.73303]]

./create-sqlite.py creates a local sqlite database
with a single table 'rtts'
in this table there are prb_id|ip|pct95|pct99 values 


rudimentary influxdb importer is available

this should allow querying influx instead of the local sqliteDB
for percentiles

something like this as an influxdb commandline:
> select PERCENTILE("value",95), "ip","prb_id" from "rtts" group by "ip","prb_id";
